Locating the "bad" message string
---------------------------------

Routers keep saying something like,

*Aug 31 11:37:50.255: %HSRP-4-BADAUTH: Bad authentication from 10.0.0.20, group 1, remote state Active

This string resides in .rodata at 0x09CB95A4. We put a trace or a watch at this
address in IDA Pro and soon we see a address which uses this string.

Location the internal MD5 implementation
----------------------------------------

We can look for the constants used in the MD5 algorithm.

Searching for "0xd76aa478" (a constant used in MD5) leads us to 0x099A54B2. We
compare this function with Solar's md5.c and see that it is "MD5_body".

This looks like a standard MD5 implementation without any Cisco specific craziness.
